<h1>Matthew Galloway</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
I'm 24 years old. I'm not really sure what I want to do after this program yet. I'm considering taking the VFX program if everything goes well. It would be very awesome if I could work with a studio like ILM. In my spare time I enjoy hanging out with my dog and playing DND and MTG with my friends. I'm also a huge football fan and spend most sundays watching as much as I can lol.
